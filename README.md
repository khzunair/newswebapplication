# News Web Application

News App, undertaken during my early learning phase, allowed me to explore API handling and modern web application development. The app offers features to access news insights, view content from original sources, and sort news by interest and mood, all while respecting usage. It aggregates top news sources into one platform. 

## Features

- **React**: Utilize the power of React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Enhance code quality and maintainability with static typing.
- **Vite**: Enjoy fast development with Vite's blazing-fast build tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Streamline styling and design with the utility-first CSS framework.
- **Integration with Trusted News Sources**: Fetch and display the latest news articles from reputable sources.
